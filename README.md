## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This

As a developer and a frequent user of online text manipulation tools, especially when working with AI-generated content, I consistently encountered frustrating limitations with existing solutions:

* **Outdated & Ad-Ridden Interfaces:** Many widely used text cleaning websites are visually outdated, difficult to navigate, and heavily cluttered with intrusive advertisements. This significantly degrades the user experience.
* **Fragmented Toolset:** It's rare to find a single, comprehensive platform that consolidates all essential text manipulation features â€“ like find, replace, and remove â€“ into one intuitive interface. This constant switching between different websites for different tasks was a daily source of frustration.
* **AI Text Cleanup Challenges:** Text copied from AI models often contains raw Markdown formatting (e.g., `*`, `#`, `` ` ``). These characters make the text hard to read and unsuitable for direct sharing. Relying on basic text editors like Windows Notepad for find-and-replace operations felt cumbersome and inefficient.

Driven by these daily frustrations, I decided to create `Simple Text Cleaner` â€“ aiming for a clean, efficient, and all-in-one web solution to simplify text processing workflows for everyone.
